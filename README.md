## About:
      This is a QR code which will link you to Frontend Mentor's website.

## Changes:
      I've made some changes in the font size and color as I see fit.
      for eg.
            color : #D6E4E5
      
      I used the hexcode for the body color instead of specified color.
      Instead of using position attribute I see margins more usefull here.


## Overall:
      The program could've been smaller but as a beginer I'll practice to make it more simple and readable.
      However I dont know javascript yet.. and nither Bootstraps.
      Let me know if I did anything wrong in the program And how can I further Improve it.
      If anybody is reading this README file Just So you know I've never made one before and don't know its functionalities. But bear with me for that...ðŸ˜…
